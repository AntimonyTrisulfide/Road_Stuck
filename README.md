# FSM Test Based Story Game
Text Based Story game, will work on windows perfectly, made using by implementing state logic based on strings, if-else and menu is implemented using switch statements, my longest piece of code till date (16-01-2024).
C++ file is uploaded in folder and the exe file is distributable.
To-Do Later -- Extend the story and implement ASCII artwork (maybe...).
